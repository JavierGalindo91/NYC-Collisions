# NYC Driver Behavior Analysis Project
## OVERVIEW
For this project we will do a mock scenario where we will pretend to be part of a data or business intelligence team at an insurance company.

### A Brief History of the NYC Driver Behavior

The Underwriting team at The Car Insurance Company TCIC is embarking on a mission to revamp their premium pricing methodology. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the landscape of urban mobility, particularly in densely populated areas like New York City. Our primary goal is to delve deep into the data to glean critical insights into how these changes have affected the driving behaviors of our NYC clientele.

By analyzing various data facets, we aim to understand the pandemic's impact on driving patterns, risk areas, and accident trends. This project is not just a data-driven endeavor but a quest to align our services with the evolving needs of our customers in these unprecedented times.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Informed Decisions**: Empower the underwriting and customer service teams with data-driven decision-making capabilities.
- **Adaptability**: Tailor our products and services to align with the dynamic needs of our customers during and post-pandemic.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Surpass stakeholder expectations by delivering comprehensive and actionable insights.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Enhance our market position through the strategic use of advanced analytics.

## METHODOLOGY
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Data Discovery**: Scrutinize the data to identify key patterns and anomalies that could influence underwriting decisions.
- **Metadata Analysis**: Gain a deep understanding of our data sources, focusing on accessibility and the structure of the data.

### Deep Dive Analysis
- **Historical Data Examination**: Conduct a thorough analysis of historical data, with a particular emphasis on factors influenced by the pandemic such as risk areas, accident trends, contributing factors, vehicle information, and person-related data.
- **Narrative Building**: Develop a narrative through our analytical approach to make the data speak to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## TECHNOLOGY
- **Cloud and Data Management**: Utilize state-of-the-art cloud and data management technologies to facilitate the analysis and seamless communication of insights.
- **Visualization and Reporting Tools**: Employ advanced visualization and reporting tools to unearth deeper findings and present them in an easily digestible format.
