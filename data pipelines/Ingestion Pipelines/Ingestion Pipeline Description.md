## OVERVIEW
In this entry we will:
1. Create data ingestion pipelines for two scenarios:
  - Mass Upload: to be performed once when setting up the application.
  - Daily Updates: to be performed in an automated manner via the AWS cloud environment.
2. Document the process in the corresponding repository.
