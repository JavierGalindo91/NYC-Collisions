# DATA INGESTION PIPELINES

## OVERVIEW
In this entry we will:
1. Create data ingestion pipelines for two scenarios:
    - **Mass Upload**: _to be performed once when setting up the application._
    - **Daily Updates**: _to be performed in an automated manner via the AWS cloud environment._
2. Document the process in the corresponding repository.
